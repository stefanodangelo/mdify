# MDify: Convert any document to Markdown  

**MDify** is a powerful Python library for converting documents into clean, structured Markdown.

Unlike other tools, **MDify** can accurately extract **tables, charts, and images**, even offering the option to save them separately for further use. \
This is particularly useful when working with documents like financial statements, spreadsheets, and data-rich reports, which usually have lots of tables and images. \
MDify categorizes images into general pictures and charts and extracts tables of any kind, even complex ones with merged cells and sparse data.

Whether you're working with *research papers*, *reports*, or *general documents*, MDify ensures the data is extracted in a structured, clean, and machine-readable format, making it ideal for tasks like fine-tuning, question answering, and document analysis in the context of Large Language Models (**LLMs**). \
By converting complex PDFs into well-structured Markdown, this tool helps streamline the input process for LLM applications, reducing the time spent on manual cleaning and formatting. With features like table extraction, image preservation, and high-quality OCR, MDify is a perfect fit for preparing large volumes of data for AI models.

**IMPORTANT**: Currently this tools only supports PDFs and images (such as text extracts, document scans, etc.) written in English.

## üöÄ Installation  
First, install **MDify** via PyPI:  

```sh
pip install mdify
```


## ‚ö° Quickstart  
Convert a document to Markdown with just a few lines of code:
```python
from mdify import DocumentParser

parser = DocumentParser()
parser.parse('PATH_TO_YOUR_DOCUMENT')
```

Or parse multiple documents from one folder at once simply by changing the last line to:
```python
parser.parse_directory('PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER')
```

Alternatively, you can also pass the document in bytes to the `parse()` method, but in this case you must also provide the document name and type manually:
```python
with open('PATH_TO_YOUR_DOCUMENT', 'rb') as f:
  document_bytes = f.read()
parser.parse(document_bytes, document_name='YOUR_DOCUMENT_NAME', document_type='pdf')
```

You can then choose the outputs to save using `DocumentParser(save_artifacts=...)`, or you can set the write mode to embedded, placeholder or described by passing the `write_mode` parameter to the `parse()` function.

**NB**: To make the best use of this library and extract meaning from images, use the following code:
```python
from mdify import WriteMode

parser.parse('PATH_TO_YOUR_DOCUMENT', write_mode=WriteMode.DESCRIBED)
```


## üîπ Key Features  
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Handles complex layouts** - Extracts text, tables, and visual elements with precision
- üñºÔ∏è **Preserves images & charts** - Gives the option to save and reuse extracted visuals for Computer Vision tasks
- üéØ **Optimized for accuracy** - Combines layout detection and OCR to extract text from documents
- ü§ñ **Preprocessing for LLM applications** - Converts documents to Markdown, which is popular for LLM training and fine-tuning tasks
- üõ†Ô∏è **Debug mode** - Save intermediate document elements as images for analysis

**NB**:
- The first run will take ~2 minutes to download the necessary models.
- Diagrams are not supported yet, therefore if you use the `DESCRIBED` write mode they may be analyzed incorrectly.
